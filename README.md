# ⭐ Image Metadata AI Viewer

A lightweight web-based tool to extract and visualize image metadata, including GPS coordinates and simulated AI-generated descriptions. Built using vanilla JavaScript, EXIF.js, and Leaflet.js, this project allows users to upload images and explore embedded metadata in a user-friendly interface.

---

## Features

- Drag-and-drop or browse image upload
- Instant image preview
- EXIF metadata extraction (camera info, date, GPS, etc.)
- Interactive map view for GPS-tagged images (via Leaflet.js)
- Simulated AI-based image description (filename-based logic)
- Refresh button to restart the session

---

## 📌 Notes

> This tool is entirely frontend-based.  
> The AI description feature is simulated using basic filename matching.  
> GPS data must be embedded in the image for map functionality to work.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main UI and layout  
- `main.js` – Handles image upload, EXIF parsing, and AI simulation  
- `map.js` – Initializes and updates the map view using Leaflet  
- `style/styles.css` – Custom styling for layout and responsiveness
